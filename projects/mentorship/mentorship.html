                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Mentorship Program was a core component of knowledge transfer at RFL, involving structured technical instruction for diverse audiences. Daily sessions with the FGC team covered Arduino programming fundamentals, REV Robotics kit operation, sensor integration, and competition strategy. Individual mentorship was provided to students like Ryan, guiding them from basic concepts to hands-on robot assembly and operation. Additional workshops were conducted for staff members, introducing Arduino basics through practical exercises like LED blinking and servo control. This initiative developed skills in curriculum development, adaptive communication, and technical instruction while building internal capacity and fostering interest in STEM fields.

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Robotics Club Initiative which is being facilitated by <strong>Robotics Foundation Limited </strong>represents a strategic effort to expand STEM education by establishing robotics clubs in primary and secondary schools throughout Blantyre. The project has involved comprehensive planning, formal stakeholder communication, and direct community engagement. Responsibilities includes drafting official communication documents, conducting school visits to meet different administrators, and organizing robot showcases to generate student interest. A major showcase at Bedir Secondary School demonstrated various robotic systems and allowed students hands-on interaction, resulting in significant student registration for new clubs. This initiative provides valuable experience in project management, professional communication, stakeholder engagement, and public presentation while contributing to national STEM education goals.
